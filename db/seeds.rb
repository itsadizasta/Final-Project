Review.create(:rating => 5, :content => "My 06 Honda Ridgline truck is been doing great after replacing timing belt, water pump and all other items related to the area of service including pulling tensioner and camshaft seals. This Chinese business owner is extremely honest with competitive prices way below the dealers. I would never go back to the dealers and I will stay with ARC Auto repair forever.
I also redid my wife's R300 Lexus with ARC because the Lexus dealer did a poor job leaving lots at leaks and some items that they did bill me but never replace it, including the 3-back spark plugs and even the inside cabin filter, can you imagine this?, so be careful of Northside Lexus service. ARC demonstrated the honesty i was looking for, so I highly recommend this mechanic shop.
I am a happy customer now!")

Review.create(:rating => 5, :content => "About two months ago, I had a major problem with my car - it kept making funny noises and seemed like it didn't have enough power to move forward. I took it to a car shop and they charged me a ton of $$$ and claimed it was fixed; less than a week later, the problem came back and that $^@#&$^ shop refused to take responsibility for it and said it was a totally different issue.
Lisa recommended that I go to ARC because she claimed they could fix anything and it would be dirt cheap. I didn't have any better ideas and figured I might as well give it a shot, and boy am I ever glad I did.
ARC doesn't look like much from the outside; looks a bit run down and the office is a mess of old newspapers and magazines. But the mechanics there are stellar, especially, their head mechanic, Teddy. This guy is awesome! He fixed my car, explained exactly what my problem was, and in the end, charged less than HALF of what I had paid that earlier shop! It's been over a month since he fixed it and it's still running smooth as when I first bought it new, so hopefully my problem is gone for good. I'd rate this place higher than 5 stars if I could - definitely the best auto repair service I've ever had!")

Review.create(:rating => 5, :content => "Integrity + Good People = Happy Customer :): My family has been visiting Teddy and his professionals for about 20 years. After every repair the owner goes back over his employees work with the manual and actualy inspects the job performed down to the specified tightness of the nuts and bolts! No kidding...
Always a pleasure doing business with them, almost like visiting your favorite family Doctor!")
